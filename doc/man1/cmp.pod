=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<cmp> command is a client implementation for the Certificate
Management Protocol (CMP) as defined in RFC4210. It can be used to
request certificates from a CA server, update their certificates,
request certificates to be revoked, and perform other CMP requests.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Display a summary of all options

=item B<-config filename>

Configuration file to use. An empty string C<""> means none.
Default file name is taken from the environment variable C<OPENSSL_CONF>.

=item B<-section names>

Section(s) to use within config file defining CMP options.
An empty string C<""> means no specific section. Default is C<cmp>.
Multiple section names may be given, separated by commas or whitespace.
Contents of sections named later may override contents of sections named before.
In any case, as usual, the S<C<[default]>> section and finally the unnamed
section (as far as present) can provide per-option fallback values.

=back


=head2 Message transfer options

=over 4

=item B<-server address[:port]>

The IP address or hostname and port (defaults to 8080) of the CMP server to connect to using HTTP/S transport.

=item B<-proxy address[:port]>

The IP address or hostname and port (defaults to 8080) of the HTTP/S proxy
server, optionally given if needed for accessing the CMP server.
TLS is not yet supported via proxy.

=item B<-path remote_path>

HTTP path location to use for the CMP server (aka CMP alias). Defaults to "/".

=item B<-msgtimeout seconds>

Number of seconds (or 0 for infinite) a CMP message round trip is
allowed to take before a timeout error is returned. Default is 120.

=item B<-totaltimeout seconds>

Maximum number seconds an enrollment may take, including attempts polling for
certificates on C<waiting> PKIStatus. Default is 0 (infinite).

=back


=head2 Server authentication options

=over 4

=item B<-recipient name>

Distinguished Name (DN) of the CMP message recipient,
i.e., the CMP server (usually a CA or RA entity).

The argument must be formatted as I</type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...>,
characters may be escaped by C<\>E<nbsp>(backslash), no spaces are skipped.

If a CMP server certificate is given with the B<-srvcert> option, its subject
name is taken as the recipient name and the B<-recipient> option is ignored.
If neither of the two are given, the recipient of the PKI message is
determined in the following order: from the B<-issuer> option if present,
the issuer of old cert given with the B<-oldcert> option if present,
the issuer of the client certificate (B<-cert> option) if present.

Setting the recipient field in the CMP header is mandatory.
If none of the above options allowing to derive the recipient name is given,
no suitable value for the recipient in the PKIHeader is available.
As last resort it is set to NULL-DN.

When a response is received, its sender must match the recipient of the request.

=item B<-expect_sender name>

Distinguished Name (DN) of the expected sender in CMP response messages,
i.e., the CMP server (usually a CA or RA entity).

The argument must be formatted as I</type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...>,
characters may be escaped by C<\>E<nbsp>(backslash), no spaces are skipped.

If not given, the subject DN of B<-srvcert>, if provided, will be used.

=item B<-srvcert filename>

The specific CMP server certificate to use and trust directly
for verifying the protection of response messages.
May be set alternatively to the B<-trusted> option
if the certificate is available and should be directly trusted.

If set, the issuer of the certificate is also used as the recipient of the CMP
request and as the expected sender of the CMP response,
overriding any potential B<-recipient> option.

=item B<-trusted filenames>

Trusted CA certificate(s) to use for CMP server authentication
when verifying responses, unless the B<-srvcert> option is given.

Multiple file names may be given, separated by commas or whitespace.
Each source may contain multiple certificates.

=item B<-untrusted sources>

Non-trusted intermediate certificate(s) that may be useful
for constructing certificate chains when verifying
the CMP server (when checking signature-based CMP message protection),
the TLS server (when establishing TLS connections),
and/or the newly enrolled certificate.

Multiple file names may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace.
Each file may contain multiple certificates.

=item B<-ignore_keyusage>

Ignore key usage restrictions in certificates at CMP level,
else C<digitalSignature> must be allowed for signer certificate.

=item B<-unprotectederrors>

Accept unprotected messages by the server even if they should have been
protected.  This applies to the following message types received from the
server:

=over 4

=item * error messages

=item * negative certificate responses (IP/CP/KUP) and revocation responses (RP)

=item * PKIConf

=back

B<WARNING:> This setting leads to unspecified behavior and it is meant
exclusively to allow interoperability with server implementations violating
RFC 4210, e.g.:

=over 4

=item * section 5.1.3.1 allows exceptions from protecting only for special
cases:
"There MAY be cases in which the PKIProtection BIT STRING is deliberately not
used to protect a message [...] because other protection, external to PKIX, will
be applied instead."

=item * section 5.3.21 is clear on ErrMsgContent: "The CA MUST always sign it
with a signature key."

=item * appendix D.4 shows PKIConf having protection

=back

=item B<-extracertsout filename>

The file where to save any extra certificates received in a response message.

=item B<-cacertsout filename>

The file where to save any received CA certificates.

=back


=head2 Client authentication options

=over 4

=item B<-ref value>

Reference number/value to use as senderKID; this is required
if no sender name can be determined from the B<-cert> or <-subject> options
and is optional when authenticating with pre-shared key (password-based MAC).

=item B<-secret arg>

Source of secret value to use for authenticating with pre-shared keys
(password-based MAC). This takes precedence over the B<-cert> option.

For more information about the format of B<arg> see the
B<PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS> section in L<openssl(1)>.

=item B<-cert filename>

The client's currently existing certificate. Unless the B<-secret> option
indicating PBM is given, this will be used for signature-based message
protection. Requires for the corresponding key to be given with B<-key>.
For IR this can be used for authenticating a request message
using an external entity certificate as defined in appendix E.7 of RFC 4210.
For KUR this is also used as certificate to be updated if the B<-oldcert>
option is not given.
If the file includes further certs, they are appended in the extraCerts field.

=item B<-key filename>

The corresponding private key file for the client's current certificate given in
the B<-cert> option.

=item B<-keypass arg>

Pass phrase source for the private key given with the B<-key> option.
Also used for B<-cert> and B<-oldcert> in case it is an encrypted PKCS#12 file.
If not given here, the password will be prompted for if needed.

For more information about the format of B<arg> see the
B<PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS> section in L<openssl(1)>.

=item B<-digest name>

Specifies name of supported digest to use in RFC 4210's MSG_SIG_ALG.
If applicable, this is used for message protection and
Proof-of-Possession (POPO) signatures.
To see the list of supported digests, use B<openssl list -digest-commands>.
Defaults to C<sha256>.

=item B<-extracerts sources>

Certificates to append in the extraCerts field when sending messages.

Multiple file names or URLs may be given, separated by commas or whitespace.
Each source may contain multiple certificates.

=item B<-unprotectedrequests>

Send messages without CMP-level protection.

but uses PKCS#10 CSR format.

B<kur> requests (key) update for an existing, given certificate.

B<rr> requests revocation of an existing, given certificate.

B<genm> requests information using a General Message, where optionally
included B<InfoTypeAndValue>s may be used to state which info is of interest.
Upon receipt of the General Response, information about all received
ITAV B<infoType>s is printed to stdout.

=item B<-infotype name>

Set InfoType name to use for requesting specific info in B<genm>,
e.g., C<signKeyPairTypes>.

=item B<-geninfo OID:int:N>

=item B<-disableconfirm>

Do not send certificate confirmation message for newly enrolled certificate to
cope with broken servers not supporting implicit confirmation correctly.

=item B<-certout filename>

=back


=head2 Certificate revocation options

=over 4

=item B<-oldcert filename>

The certificate to be updated (i.e., renewed or re-keyed) in KUR
or to be revoked in RR. It must be given for RR, else it defaults to B<-cert>.

The reference certificate determined in this way, if any, is also used for
deriving default subject DN and Subject Alternative Names for IR, CR, and KUR.
Its issuer, if any, is used as default recipient in the CMP message header
if neither B<-srvcert>, B<-recipient>, nor B<-issuer> is available.

=item B<-revreason number>

        removeFromCRL           (8),
        privilegeWithdrawn      (9),
        aACompromise           (10)
    }

=back


=head2 Credentials format options

=over 4

=item B<-ownform PEM|DER|P12>

Format to try first when reading files and to use for writing files containing
own (i.e., client-side) certificates.
Default value is PEM.

=item B<-keyform PEM|DER|P12>

Format to try first when reading key files. Default value is PEM.

=item B<-crlform PEM|DER>

Format to try first when reading CRL files. Default value is PEM.

=item B<-otherform PEM|DER|P12>

Format to try first when reading files and to use for writing files containing
certificates of other parties (i.e., the server side).
Default value is PEM.

=item B<-otherpass arg>

Pass phrase source for certificate given with the B<-trusted>, B<-untrusted>,
B<-out_trusted>, B<-extracerts>, B<-tls_extra>, or B<-tls_trusted> options.
If not given here, the password will be prompted for if needed.

For more information about the format of B<arg> see the
B<PASS PHRASE ARGUMENTS> section in L<openssl(1)>.

=item B<-batch>

Do not interactively prompt for input, for instance when a password is needed.
This can be useful for batch processing and testing.

=item B<-engine id>

Specifying an crypto engine B<id> will cause L<cmp(1)> to obtain a functional
reference to the specified engine, thus initializing it if needed. The engine
will be used for all algorithms supported for keys prefixed by C<engine:>.
Engines may be defined in the OpenSSL config file as usual in an engine section.

Options specifying keys, like B<-key>, B<-newkey>, B<-tls_key> can prefix
C<engine:> to engine-specific identifiers for security tokens objects held by
the engine. The following example utilizes the RFC 7512 PKCS #11 URI scheme as
supported e.g. by libp11:
S<C<-key engine:pkcs11:object=my-private-key;type=private;pin-value=1234>>

=head2 Certificate verification options, for both CMP and TLS

=over 4

=item B<-crl_check>

The B<-crl_check>, B<-crl_download>, and B<-crls> options enable mandatory
certificate status checking for at least the leaf certificate
using CRLs unless OCSP is enabled and succeeds.

=item B<-crl_check_all>

Extend revocation status checking (using CRLs) to full certificate chain.

=item B<-crl_download>

Retrieve CRLs from distribution points given in certificates,
as primary source.

This option enables CRL checking for, e.g., the CMP/TLS server certificate
as it is the leaf certificate of the certificate chain.
Compare B<X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK>.

=item B<-crls URLs>

Use given CRL(s) as secondary source of certificate revocation information. The
URLs argument may be a single element or a comma- or whitespace-separated list,
each element starting with C<http:> or C<file:> or being simply a local file name.

This option enables CRL checking for, e.g., the CMP/TLS server certificate
as it is the leaf certificate of the certificate chain.
Compare B<X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK>.

=item B<-ocsp_check_all>

Require revocation status checking (via OCSP) for full certificate chain.
On OCSP response error try revocation status checking using CRLs if enabled.
This option has little sense without B<-ocsp_use_aia> or B<-ocsp_url>.

=item B<-ocsp_use_aia>

Use OCSP with any AIA entries in certificates as primary URL of OCSP responder.
On OCSP response error try revocation status checking using CRLs if enabled.

Use OCSP with given URL as secondary (fallback) address of OCSP responder.
On OCSP response error try revocation status checking using CRLs if enabled.

=item B<-ocsp_timeout seconds>

Timeout for retrieving responses from OCSP responders (or 0 for none).
Default is 10 seconds.

=item B<-ocsp_status>

Enable certificate status for TLS server certificate via OCSP stapling.
Multi-stapling is not (yet) supported. Not available before OpenSSL 1.1.

=item B<-policy>, B<-purpose>, B<-verify_name>, B<-verify_depth>,

=head1 EXAMPLES

Note: in these examples the C<\> at line ends means
the invocation should be all on one line.

Requesting "all relevant information" with an empty General Message.
This prints information about all received ITAV B<infoType>s to stdout.

  openssl cmp -cmd genm -server 127.0.0.1:8080 -path pkix/ \
    -ref 1234 -secret pass:1234-5678-1234-5678 \
    -recipient "/CN=CMPserver"

Sending an initial request message to a CMP server running on the local
host, using a pre-shared secret key for authentication. In this example
the client does not have the CA certificate yet, so we specify the CA's
name with B<-recipient> and save any CA certificates that we may receive
in the  C<capubs.pem> file.

  openssl genrsa -out cl_key.pem
  openssl cmp -cmd ir -server 127.0.0.1:8080 -path pkix/ \
    -ref 1234 -secret pass:1234-5678-1234-5678 \
    -recipient "/CN=CMPserver" \
    -newkey cl_key.pem -subject "/CN=MyName" \
    -cacertsout capubs.pem -certout cl_cert.pem

Then, when the keys for this certificate need to be updated, the client
can send a key update request.

  openssl genrsa -out cl_key_new.pem
  openssl cmp -cmd kur -server 127.0.0.1:8080 -path pkix/ \
    -cert cl_cert.pem -key cl_key.pem \
    -recipient "/CN=CMPserver" \
    -trusted capubs.pem \
    -newkey cl_key_new.pem -certout cl_cert_new.pem
